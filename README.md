<summary> <h2> TASK 3</h2></summary>
<h3>To understand the instruction type and find out instruction type used in previous RISC-V objdump.To find exact 32 bit instruction code. </h3>
Task 3 involves completion of the following tasks
<br>
<ol>
  <li> List various RISC-V instruction type (R, I, S, B, U, J) after going through RISC-V software documentation </li>
  <li> Identify 15 unique RISC-V instructions from riscv-objdmp of your application code  </li>
  <li> Identify exact 32-bit instruction code in the instruction type format for 15 unique instructions </li>
  <li> Upload the 32-bit pattern on Github </li>
</ol>
RISC-V Instruction Types (R,I,S,B,U,J):
In RISC-V architecture, instructions are classified into different instruction types based on their format and usage. There are six main instruction types: R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, and J-type. Each type has a different purpose and layout in the instruction format.

1. R-type (Register)
   
Purpose: Used for operations that involve registers, such as arithmetic or logic operations between two registers.

opcode: Operation code (6 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits)

rs1: First source register (5 bits)

rs2: Second source register (5 bits)

funct3: Function code (3 bits)

funct7: Additional function code (7 bits)

2. I-type (Immediate)

Purpose: Used for operations involving an immediate value (constant) and a register.

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits)

rs1: Source register (5 bits)

imm: Immediate value (12 bits)

3. S-type (Store)
   
Purpose: Used for store operations, where data is stored from a register to memory.

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rs1: Base register (5 bits)

rs2: Source register (5 bits)

funct3: Function code (3 bits)

imm: Immediate value (12 bits, split into two parts)

4.B-type (Branch)

Purpose: Used for branch operations, which control program flow based on conditions (e.g., branch if equal, branch if less than).

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rs1: First register (5 bits)

rs2: Second register (5 bits)

funct3: Function code (3 bits)

imm: Immediate value (12 bits, split into multiple fields)

5. U-type (Upper Immediate)
   
Purpose: Used for instructions that operate on an immediate value, especially for setting a large immediate value in the upper 20 bits.

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits)

imm: Immediate value (20 bits)

6. J-type (Jump)
   
Purpose: Used for jump operations, which are typically used to perform unconditional jumps (like a function call or returning from a function).

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits, typically used for the return address in some instructions)

imm: Immediate value (20 bits, split into multiple fields)

 <b>OVERVIEW:</b>
  <br>
  <br>
The Advanced Easy-to-Use Burglar Alarm employs an ultrasonic radar sensor to detect objects moving within its view, triggering a passive buzzer to alert the user of any intrusion. Unlike laser-based systems that use an LDR and require precise alignment and complex setup, this alarm is simple to install. It needs only to be placed facing a solid surface within a 0.1â€“4 meter range. On activation, its LED lights up briefly, during which it automatically measures the distance to the surface and sets this as its detection threshold. After setup, any object passing through its field activates the buzzer. Powered by a 5V DC source, it can run via adapter or battery pack for flexibility.
