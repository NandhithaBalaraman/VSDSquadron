Task 3 involves completion of the following tasks
<br>
<ol>
  <li> List various RISC-V instruction type (R, I, S, B, U, J) after going through RISC-V software documentation </li>

</ol>
RISC-V Instruction Types (R,I,S,B,U,J):
In RISC-V architecture, instructions are classified into different instruction types based on their format and usage. There are six main instruction types: R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, and J-type. Each type has a different purpose and layout in the instruction format.

1. R-type (Register)
   
Purpose: Used for operations that involve registers, such as arithmetic or logic operations between two registers.

opcode: Operation code (6 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits)

rs1: First source register (5 bits)

rs2: Second source register (5 bits)

funct3: Function code (3 bits)

funct7: Additional function code (7 bits)

2. I-type (Immediate)

Purpose: Used for operations involving an immediate value (constant) and a register.

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits)

rs1: Source register (5 bits)

imm: Immediate value (12 bits)

3. S-type (Store)
   
Purpose: Used for store operations, where data is stored from a register to memory.

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rs1: Base register (5 bits)

rs2: Source register (5 bits)

funct3: Function code (3 bits)

imm: Immediate value (12 bits, split into two parts)

4.B-type (Branch)

Purpose: Used for branch operations, which control program flow based on conditions (e.g., branch if equal, branch if less than).

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rs1: First register (5 bits)

rs2: Second register (5 bits)

funct3: Function code (3 bits)

imm: Immediate value (12 bits, split into multiple fields)

5. U-type (Upper Immediate)
   
Purpose: Used for instructions that operate on an immediate value, especially for setting a large immediate value in the upper 20 bits.

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits)

imm: Immediate value (20 bits)

6. J-type (Jump)
   
Purpose: Used for jump operations, which are typically used to perform unconditional jumps (like a function call or returning from a function).

opcode: Operation code (7 bits)

rd: Destination register (5 bits, typically used for the return address in some instructions)

imm: Immediate value (20 bits, split into multiple fields)

 <b>OVERVIEW:</b>
  <br>
  <br>
A Full Adder is a digital circuit that adds three binary inputs: two significant bits (A and B) and a carry-in (Cin). It outputs a Sum and a carry-out (Cout). The logic is defined as:

Sum = 
ùê¥
‚äï
ùêµ
‚äï
ùê∂
ùëñ
ùëõ
A‚äïB‚äïCin (XOR operation).
Cout = 
(
ùê¥
‚ãÖ
ùêµ
)
+
(
ùê∂
ùëñ
ùëõ
‚ãÖ
(
ùê¥
‚äï
ùêµ
)
)
(A‚ãÖB)+(Cin‚ãÖ(A‚äïB)) (AND/OR operation).
It is a key component in arithmetic circuits like ripple-carry adders, enabling multi-bit binary addition. Commonly used in processors and ALUs, it plays a vital role in performing binary arithmetic operations.
